### Project Two - 100DaysofCode
# Password Generator
This is a simple program that collects two inputs from a user; *length* and *number*, and returns a list of passwords based of the inputs. *Length* denotes the number of characters that make the password, whereas *Number* denotes the number of passwords the user wants.

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Import required library(s).
3. Create a variable to collect the *number* and *length* of the password(s).
4. Use nested loops first to run the *number*, then the *length*.
5. Print the output.
6. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* This program thought me how to use nested loops efficiently. 
* I also learnt about the random library today.
* I also do think there's a better way to define the character set though I'm yet to find out.
